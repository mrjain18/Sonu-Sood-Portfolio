<b> Sood Charity Foundation </b><br>
Sood has founded the Sood Charity Foundation "to help people of all stature".<br><br>

<b> Social work during the COVID-19 pandemic </b><br>
In May 2020, during the nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sood helped thousands of stranded Indian migrant workers to reach their homes by arranging buses, special trains and chartered flights for them. In July 2020 he arranged a chartered flight to bring home over 1,500 Indian students stranded in Kyrgyzstan, flying them from Bishkek to Varanasi. His charity during the pandemic was lauded, and he was hailed as a real-life hero in India.

On 25 July 2020, a video of a farmer's daughters ploughing a field, like bulls with a yoke on their shoulders, went viral over social media. Sood quickly sent the family a tractor. On 5 August 2020, he helped 101 medical students, predominantly from Tamil Nadu, who were stranded in Moscow during the lockdown, reach Chennai safely on a chartered flight arranged by him after they contacted his team <img class="img1" src="https://gumlet.assettype.com/freepressjournal%2F2021-05%2F339b5c1b-fc26-4d3e-b781-0efd2982a7ba%2FSonu_sood_residence.jpg?w=1200" alt="sonusood4" width="300" height="250" border=5px solid black;> for help. On his birthday he launched a website and app called Pravasi Rojgar to help migrant workers find suitable jobs amid the pandemic. On 19 February 2021, Sood launched an initiative 'Ilaaj India' platform to provide healthcare services for needy people. In December 2020 he published I Am No Messiah, autobiographical book, narrating his journey to become an actor, and narrating his social work during the pandemic.

On 17 April 2021, Sonu Sood tested positive for Coronavirus disease. He also shared a message for his fans in his post that read: "Covid - positive. Mood and spirit - super positive. Hi everyone, this is to inform you that I have tested positive this morning for COVID-19. As a part of precautions, I have already quarantined myself and taking utmost care. But don't worry this gives me ample time to solve your problems. Remember I am always there for you all."

In 2021, Sood provided much-needed oxygen plants and cylinders for COVID-19 patients in India. Sood and Kumar Vishwas have supported the Aao Gaon Bachayein ("Save the Villages") campaign started by comic poet and satirist Pankaj Prasun. <br><br>

<b> Sambhavam – IAS coaching scholarship </b>
An initiative by Sood for providing free coaching to UPSC exam candidates from underprivileged financial backgrounds.
